                <td>Yep, I ideally would like to land in a programming sort of role and position but I would like to be both a programmer and designer for both websites and software. I feel like I need to experiment and push myself interms of programming skills in order to reach an ample level where I can confidently multi-task programming and designing.</td>

I always aim to put deadlines and keep to them striclty and urge my partners to do so when working on any project. A strength I would like my partner to have is to respect and follow the designated deadline and let the group know in advance if the deadline is too inconvenient for them.</td>
